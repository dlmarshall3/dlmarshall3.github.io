A place for me to collect my thoughts and, hopefully, offer some encouragement to fellow "bootcampers."

I've done the whole "have an internet following" thing, and I don't like it.

Life is too short for that.

About me:
=========

32, married, father of two, Kansas City, fan of tokusatsu and theology (especially when combined).
