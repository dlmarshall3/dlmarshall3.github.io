A place for me to collect my thoughts and, hopefully, offer some encouragement to fellow "bootcampers."

No guarantees I will **only** post about software engineering. I like too many other things to make that guarantee.

I've also done the whole "have an internet following" thing, and I don't like it, so that's not why I'm doing this.

Life is too short for that nonsense.

About me:
=========

Hi, I'm David!

As you can probably guess, I am a "software engineer." Well, I **will be** soon. Currently slinging cars and trucks, even though the market has gone in the üöΩ. I used to make websites as a kid, taught myself HTML with one of those "...for Dummies" books, but never stuck with it. Figured now is a great time, and I've been enjoying my time going through Springboard's bootcamp.

That said, when I'm not coding or spending time with my wife and two kids, I enjoy tokusatsu (Japanese special effects shows/movies), reading theology books, and thinking/talking about technology, ethics, and why social media is a blight on our society. (Yet here I am, actively posting on LinkedIn.....I hate it.

Henshin...what?
=========
_Henshin_ is Japanese for "transform," used in the context of going from one form into another. Unless you're Patrick Star and live under a rock, you're familiar with one of the most popular henshin hero shows: **Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers**, which was adapted from the Japanese show **Ky≈çry≈´ Sentai Zyuranger.** I'm not a huge Super Sentai fan; I'm more of an Ultraman kind of guy. (In fact, before I started the bootcamp, my best friend and I had a fairly successful Ultraman podcast! Hoping we can start that back up once I finish.) Anyway, I figured if I was going to come up with a name for my blog, why not do something unique and relating to an interest of mine? Thus, the Henshin Coder was born!
