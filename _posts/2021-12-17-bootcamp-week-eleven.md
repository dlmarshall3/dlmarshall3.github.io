Bootcamp: week eleven

_Listening to:_ The Body - Earth Groans

Part of me doesn't want to write today. And by part of me, I mean almost all of me. There's nothing quite like your daughter getting a stomach bug, only for her to pass it onto your oldest...and then you end up getting it shortly after. I was out of commission for nearly two days, and I still don't feel quite 100% yet. But I did decide in the midst of this to try cutting back on coffee and caffeine, so technically I'm on day five? And I'm doing okay?

I think.

Before I talk about coding, I wanted to clarify a point I made in a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6877446051473719297/) last night. That is, the concern I have seeing people trying to find the path of least resistance when it comes to switching careers, and the wares LinkedInfluencers peddle from their pedestals. I **do** think there are certain things that are, by and large, universal, and one of them is the importance of referrals/substantial connections. If I was a hiring manager, I absolutely would focus my time and attention on candidates who had been referred to me directly compared to a stranger. Is that right? I'm not sure. I recognize I would be losing out on potential great hires, absolutely. But in a market where there are a lot of people trying to make the same kind of transition, can you really blame someone for wanting to start with a referral that has, hopefully, been vetted over a complete unknown?

Again, my concern is less about what is right or wrong, but more about the reality of the matter.

Also, I still stand by the fact at lot of us, myself included, are getting rejected from jobs because we aren't the right fit. As I've said before, I know that doesn't garner the clicks, but...

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**Coding stuff:**

As I mentioned above, I've been pretty exhausted/out of it the past week, and the week before that, it was more of real life getting in the way of knocking out some coursework. But man, what a great feeling it is, to sit behind the keyboard and just lose myself for a few hours. I decided to go back to Python after spending some time in React; it's not that React was overwhelming me, but I realized I need to have some diversity in my skillset, so to speak. I still don't quite understand how Python is going to play out in an application sense, as we're still going the basics, but I can see why so many different disciplines are utilizing Python for their research.

All I know is I'm excited to make a text-based adventure game.

Don't really have a whole lot more to say currently. I stopped doing the #100daysofcode challenge, but starting next week, I'll have more concrete examples to include in this post. This was more of a "I just need to get back into the habit of writing" exercise.

And I didn't fail.
