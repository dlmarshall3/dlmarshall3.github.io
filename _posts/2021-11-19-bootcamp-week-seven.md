Bootcamp: week seven
------

I took my first "L" in the bootcamp this week.

After completing the assignments from week six (the GIPHY Party and TV Maze exercises), it was time to move onto Jeopardy. Being an assessment, it's structured a bit differently: the goal is to, well, _assess_ where you are at with the course and where you need to improve. And after about twenty hours, the assessment was clear: **I still have a long way to go.**

On paper, the assigment made sense. Taking information from the [jService API](https://jservice.io/), my first task was to gather category IDs and then populate my page with the following from the appropriate endpoint: category name, and then five question/answer pairs from the respective category. I spent an hour or so designing the page (which I eventually threw out the window at the end, which is a point I'll come back to), and then dove deep into the API work. Again, on paper, I knew what I needed to do, but it was the matter of getting my data from the endpoint into an object I could utilize for the DOM, and I just couldn't make it work. Hour after hour after hour, I would come close. At one point, I had thirty objects: one object with the category title, then five objects with the question/answer pair like I needed. But I just couldn't figure out how to get them all together!

Eventually, I "broke the rules" and asked a classmate for advice. It was less about getting the answer, and more the affirmation of, "Hey, am I on the right track?" After some brainstorming, it became clear that the work I wanted to do could be done through **one** endpoint instead of two, as I previously assumed, and lo and behold! I got my data into the objects like I needed! It felt like such a breath of fresh air.

I'll be honest, though: at this point, I was already incredibly exhausted. I had spent a lot of time, hours upon hours upon hours, to get to where I was at. There have been some external stressors that, undoubtedly, made this assessment harder than it needed to be. And I recognize I didn't know enough to counter their effects. Which is why, after nearly 20 hours of working on the assignment, I submitted the assignment...incomplete. I had to take a deep look at myself and acknowledge where I had been lacking, what things I should have been studying more, and I'll take those experiences into my next assignment, which I start this evening.

Am I disheartened? Not really. It was embarassing to submit something I didn't feel 100% proud of, but I learned some good lessons. 

**First?** I love designing my projects (my [Pokenect Four](https://github.com/dlmarshall3/pokenect_four) project is proof of this), but it's probably best for me to spend that time once I've established the logic and fundamentals to the assignment first. That's always something I can do at work when I have free time. 

**Second?** Planning, planning, planning. My most effective hours on this assignment were the result of me breaking everything down on a conceptual level and then finding out how to turn that into code. It's when I lost sight of this that I found myself the most frustrated and confused. 

**Third?** Having a schedule is important. Huge shoutout to Aaron Hayslip of [Parsity.io](https://parsity.io/) / [Develop Yourself Podcast](https://parsity.io/podcast/) for [creating this template](https://parsity.io/links/focus/). I made myself a schedule previously, but for some reason, as I worked through his template, I not only discovered more time for sleep (!!!), but I also was able to accomplish the same amount of coding time while still taking an evening off. (Of course, it's been tough this week, sticking to the schedule, but we're getting there!)

**Fourth?** Reviewing fundamentals is important. I have been spending time this week practicing filter/map, and man, this would have helped me so much in this Jeopardy assignment. One of my initial struggles has been not always knowing where to go when I know I have a problem. That is, with Jeopardy, there were times where the amount of clues I'd get from a category would be ten to fifteen, which made the initial page load unbearable. After spending ten minutes reviewing filter yesterday, though, I was able to come up with a line of code that would have helped...and it would have been a single line of code at that!

**Fifth?** 1 Peter 1:6-7. "In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ." Now, I understand not everyone who reads this blog is a Christian. That's fine. But I think the main idea remains: _we are made stronger because of trials._ Instead of being discouraged and giving up because of a setback, I'm pushing back, harder than ever. It's just like when I used to wrestle. I wasn't a better wrestler by competing against people under my weight class or by people I knew I'd pin immediately. It was a combination of grueling conditioning, strict discipline, and wrestling against, oftentimes, state champions that made me a better wrestler. In the same way, yes, this assignment kicked my butt in five hundred different ways... But that doesn't mean I didn't come out the other side a better developer.

That said, I'm excited for the next portion of the course. I've got the infamous "Hack or Snooze" assignment, along with some more career/LinkedIn work, but then...

So, so, so excited.
