Bootcamp: week five
--------

It’s 9:30am, I’ve had one cup of coffee, and I already feel like I could pass out at any minute.

In all seriousness, the thought of doing this bootcamp for another eight months is taxing. Don’t get me wrong—I’ve loved the experience so far. I am a firm believer in not having regrets in life, but there **are** moments where I really wish I would have either a) stuck with coding when I was a kid, or b) committed to doing a bootcamp back in 2019 when I was initially motivated to get back into coding. At that time, however, I was under the impression you had to get a degree, so having just recently completed my Master’s, the thought of more schooling was…

Well…

But back to my current experiences: **I’m exhausted to the nth degree.** It’s not just working full-time (45-50 hours/week) plus the coursework. It’s making sure I’m not neglecting my family and being as present as possible, and *also* having to make sacrifices in those areas as well. My family has been incredibly supportive and understanding, especially my wife. It’s easy to become resentful or bitter in situations like this, but to say she is compassionate, patient, and loving is the understatement of the century. I wouldn’t be able to do this without her, which is why I want this so badly. I’ve said it time and time again, but my family deserves the best husband and father possible, and making this transition is vital to that.

Which means adjusting my studying schedule. After being sick for a week, I felt like I needed to “cram” as much coursework to get back on track, which resulted in me staying up later, which then resulted in me not waking up early and feeling like crap every morning. As a result, I’ve committed to ending my work earlier in the evening so that I can do work in the morning as well. I want to make sure I retain what I’m learning, and the more my studying creeps into the witching hour, the less I get done/remember.

As for the work I’ve been doing? I’m really proud of my Connect Four project. It took getting to this point in the curriculum for me to recognize why these assignments are structured this way. That is, when we are given the solution for the project, it’s not cheating to consult it. In fact, there’s an expectation you’ll want to look at it. The majority of students coming into any bootcamp will have little to no prior experience, so of course someone four weeks into a bootcamp won’t have a full grasp on JavaScript game logic.

However, what changed for me is when my mentor told me to write out what I want my code to do…without writing the code. Planning and preparing is such an important part of the engineering process, I’m learning, and it’s not enough to know all of the different methods and such if I don’t even understand what I’m trying to do. As a result, even though I had to consult the solution code to finish the project (and fix some of my mistakes), I was able to inspect the project, analyze it, and walk away with a better understanding.

Mission accomplished.
