Bootcamp: week eight
---------------

**Introduction:**

If you can’t tell, I tend to write more about my bootcamp **experience** more than the languages I’m learning. It’s not that my learning isn’t part of the experience; far from it. Rather, like most things in life, my overall experience (I need another word to use here) has been determined by my mental state, and if my writing on this blog can help someone else in their studies, or even in their career, then praise the Lord.

That said, I do have some “coding stuff” to talk about.

**Bootcamp time:**

I’ve barely done any work this week! My progress bar has literally increased zero percent.

This isn’t to say I haven’t done **any** work. In fact, I have spent a lot of time in VS Code over the past few days. Instead, after last week’s Jeopardy assignment and the next assignment I started, Hack or Snooze, I needed a bit of a palate cleanser. I’ve been going hard for the past eight weeks, and having a blast, don’t get me wrong, but I wanted to actually make something from scratch.

And make it I did! There is still a lot of work to be done: kinks to be ironed out, more optimization for mobile devices, and refactoring the code, especially when it comes to the API. But you know what? I made something, and I’m proud of it. What made the experience better, however, was working with other people; brainstorming, debugging, throwing ideas against the wall. Jesse, Phil, Konnie, Dane, and **especially** my son, Jasper: I am indebted to your kindness and generosity!

I really do need to finish Hack or Snooze, though. Python is something I’ve been looking forward to for a while now. But man, if you’ve gone through the Springboard/Rithm School curriculum, you know how much of a beast this assignment is. I cannot wait until I can look back at it and go, “I understand why it gave me problems, but this is **nothing** compared to what I’m doing now."

**Career thoughts:**

Earlier in the week, I shared some thoughts about getting ghosted by recruiters:

It ended up being my most viewed/engaged with post I’ve had to date, which is funny, because I was afraid of it coming off **too strongly**. However, it doesn’t seem like that was the case, and I’m thankful. The last thing I wanted to do was make anyone feel bad for having these moments of frustration, because I do get it: investing your time into the application process, only to feel like you’re not being valued or respected sucks big time. However, there are so many potential reasons **why** someone might not get back with you, and I’m of the opinion I’d rather spend a few minutes every several days following up instead of sitting around wondering what’s going on. If you don’t end up getting the job? You didn’t waste a lot of time. If you do? Talk about an amazing ROI!

That said, I thought about sharing these next thoughts in a LinkedIn post, but I wanted to flesh them out a little differently. I recognize this will reduce my “reach,” so to speak, but hey. I’m not on LinkedIn to build a brand, so if you’re reading at this point? I thank you.

Topic of the day? **Referrals**.

There is a reason I’m focusing on this topic, although the details are not important at the moment. I’ve been noticing ever since I started paying attention to senior engineers worth their salt, there has been a common thread in getting your first job: referrals. Gone is the mantra that you should “spray and pray,” hoping that maybe one of the jobs you desperately clicked on will hire you. Instead, while there are different ways this will play out, the common thread for referrals is: **find a way to have someone vouch for you**. Once that happens, your chances of landing a job go up substantially, which also means reducing the time blindly applying.

You’re probably thinking, “David, of course I know that. I hear that all the time.” And you’re right! I’ve rarely, if ever, claimed to come up with anything new in my writing. But something I do want to suggest is instead of spending time on LinkedIn trying to build those connections and referrals, it’s worth considering going back to where referrals used to come from: in-person connections.

For people who know me intimately, my [disdain for social media](https://dlmarshall3.substack.com/p/social-media-and-deformation) won’t come as a surprise, but that’s not what I’m getting at here, at least not entirely. Rather, it’s that as we’ve progressively moved towards mediating our reality through social media networks, it’s easy to forget about the relationships outside of our friends list. This week, I’ve spent sometime thinking about how connections and referrals got me jobs without the typical application/waiting game grind, and I wanted to share some examples here.

<ul>
  <li>Although this wasn’t really a “job,” when I joined the Burial in 2009, they had been a band for four years at that point. We were signed to a fairly small label, but when we signed with Facedown Records in 2010, it was because of another band on Facedown referring us to Jason, who ran the label. It wasn’t that we suddenly became a better band, but this personal endorsement was enough to get Jason’s attention.</li>
  
  <li>In 2013, I started shining shoes professionally. Yes, you read that right: I used to be a shoe shiner. What’s funny, though, is I had been getting my haircut at this barbershop for months before working there. There was no referral to get me a job, but when I came in for the interview, they knew who I was, so it was a no-brainer, despite having zero experience. (Which, let’s be honest: I was shining shoes worth more than a single week’s paycheck. That was a big deal.) In fact, it was my time at the barbershop that helped me get a new job as a property manager. My soon-to-be boss was a client of mine, and after watching me work for months, he asked me if I wanted to work for him. I took the job, of course, but it was hard, especially after my current boss gave me a great counter offer.</li>

  <li>Now, not all referrals ended up being good for me. A friend of my wife’s got me an in with the company he worked for, and…well… I left shortly after because of some pretty major ethical concerns. But the actual application process? Incredibly easy. I’m pretty sure I applied and was hired within a week.</li>
  
  <li>And in the easiest job application ever, I started selling at a car dealership without ever interviewing with the GM or head managers. It’s all because I had a solid relationship with the used car manager. I had bought four cars from him previously, and once I started selling cars myself, he had been begging me to work for him. Once I finally made the decision to do so, all I had to do was fill out an application for legality purposes, do the background check, and I started immediately.</li>
  
</ul>

Maybe we’ve reached a point where I start imagining dialogue again: “That sounds great and all, David, but first: we’re not talking about software engineering jobs. And plus: I’m not good at this networking thing, _especially_ in person.” Which is fair! I get that. I’m one of those rare introverts that knows how to turn up the heat, so to speak, when it’s necessary, but otherwise? I’m happy to be alone.

However, I was talking to my wife about referrals this week, and I was reminded one of her best nannying jobs came by way of a referral. Her friend wasn’t able to work for a family anymore, so a few weeks before we got married, my wife took over for her friend. It was a fairly seamless process! Then my wife clued me in on something: _every single job she’s ever had came by way of a referral._ It was always a friend letting her know about a job opening or, if she was interested, having that connection to get in. I bring this up, because my wife is the opposite of me: she is the introvert in the relationship.

I’m not saying LinkedIn can’t help you land a job. I’m not saying referrals are the only ways to get a job. But I really do think when you see senior engineers talk about their experiences, how they see, time and time again, the success that comes from talking to our friends and colleagues, the ones who know us and can vouch for us, then maybe it’s worth investing our time into this approach instead of, again, the “spray and pray” method. While I recognize I am, again, **not employed as an engineer therefore my opinion is clearly biased in that regard**, it breaks my heart to see the “I’ve submitted 700-1000 applications and still don’t have a job” posts almost every day, and I wish I could sit down with these people and figure out a game plan to change things up a bit.

My prayer is this post might help someone take that first step.

**Soli deo gloria.**
