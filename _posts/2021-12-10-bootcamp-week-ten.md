Bootcamp: week ten
---------------------

One of the hardest things about being in an asynchronous bootcamp is...well, that it's asynchronous. For the first few weeks, I was trucking along, ahead of schedule. Then I hit that first wall. It wasn't burnout, if you remember, but getting pretty sick in addition to my wife flying down to Florida to see her grandfather before he passed. It seems like since that week, I haven't been able to get back on track. This doesn't mean I'm doing _poorly_, just that if I'm basing my "success" off of the study plan, I'm not quite there.

Would it have been better if I was in an actual cohort where I had to hit deadlines each week? I'm not sure. Working full-time and balancing family responsibilities would lead me to say no. The beauty of the Springboard program is as long as I'm at a certain point by the end of the nine months, I'll get an extension with no penalty. I am almost halfway to that requirement, so I don't foresee that being an issue.

This brings me to why I committed to a bootcamp, though: the accountability. Over the past few days, I've been pretty quiet in the Slack chat, thanks to...well, a multitude of reasons. Which led one of my classmates to reach out and see if I was doing okay. I wouldn't have had that if I was going down the self-taught route on my own. I've also been indebted, time and time again, to Jack, my mentor, and again- I wouldn't have had this doing a solo campaign. And let's be honest: even if I don't get done in **exactly** nine months, it's very likely doing self-taught would take me longer, if I finished at all.

I don't know where I'm going with this. Like I mentioned above, it's been a long week. I didn't even want to write anything, but I felt like if I gave myself a week off from this, it'd be harder to come back next week. Consistency is key, right?

If y'all could be praying for me, that'd be amazing. Life is pretty rough right now. The Lord is faithful, his promises are always true, but it doesn't mean things don't look less-than-ideal right now.

Hoping to have something of more substance next week.
