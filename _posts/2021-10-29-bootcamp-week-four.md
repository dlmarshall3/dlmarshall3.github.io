## Bootcamp: week four

**Currently listening to:** _The Black Parade_ by My Chemical Romance

Man, what a blast to the past. I was never a huge MCR fan back in the day, but I have to confess: _The Black Parade_ is a stellar album. There's not a single song on here that's bad.

Anyway.

I can't believe I've almost completed my first month of the bootcamp? I guess if you factor in the prep class I took, it's been over a month. Still, it's been a really enlightening and trying experience. Enlightening because there's no doubt about it: **I really enjoy coding.** I knew I'd like it, considering my past experiences, but back then, JavaScript and CSS were in their infancy. So much of what I'm learning right now is brand new to me, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. At first, the amount of troubleshooting and problem solving I was facing was daunting, but now? _It's thrilling._ 

For example, my upcoming assignment is to build a Connect Four game. I haven't quite gotten to the actual project, so during my freetime at work, I've been working on the "aesthetics," so to speak. I wanted to design something my son would enjoy playing with me, so I made it Pokemon themed. To keep with that theme (and show some appreciation for one of my favorite games ever, Dr. Mario), I wanted to have a "Chill" and "Fever" mode (which really only amounts to a different look and music), but I wanted the mode selection to look like you were playing an actual video game. After hours of talking to a Springboard TA and researching different methods, trying to figure out why only ONE HALF of the "Pokeball selector" would appear, I finally was able to make it work:

But **then** I wanted a sound effect to play as you hover over each option. I learned quickly that until the user interacts with the DOM, it's really tricky to get audio to autoplay. Which then required me to figure out how to get that interaction without it seeming forced. My solution? Having the user click the "play" button, which hides once clicked and reveals the Chill/Fever options.

All of that to say: _I am having a lot of fun, and it's crazy to think it's only been a few weeks._

However, things have been trying as well, which is less about the curriculum and more to do with my current work situation. I talk to my son a lot about how we are the ones in charge of our emotions, that no one can make us angry or frustrated, and he understands this...so it's hard to watch 

**[redacted]**

Nope. After reviewing what I wrote, I'm going to bite my tongue/fingers here. Let's just put it this way: _it's a very exasperating and depressing time to be in the car industry right now, which is inspiring me to no end to excel with this bootcamp so I can get the heck out of dodge._

One day at a time!
