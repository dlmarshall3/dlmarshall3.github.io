Bootcamp: week six
--------

"Perception is key."

So much in life is determined by our views on reality and truth. This is something my mentor and I talked about during our call this week, that even though it **feels** like I've been doing this bootcamp for months and I should be further along, I'm really only six weeks into the course. Not only this, but when I see other people in my cohort much further along, it's easy to be tempted to get discouraged. Yet if I take the time to remember some key points, I'm quickly reoriented: 

1) some people have more time to do this than I do!
2) some people have a lot more experience than I do!
3) some people are just going to be more adept at learning than I am!

None of this is to disparage myself. Rather, it's simply recognizing what the truth of the matter is and being okay with that! I am where I am for a reason, and there is no value in continually comparing myself to others. (Easier said than done, of course.)

But this is why I'm thankful I decided to go the bootcamp route. Do I think I could have taught myself through tutorials and such? Maybe. It's likely. But having the mentor experience, along with countless friends I've made in the process, is invaluable. It truly, truly is.

As for what I'm learning? It doesn't feel like I've gone through much of the curriculum since last week, but again: perception is key.

**Object-oriented programming:** I heard a lot about "this" before starting the unit, and to be fair, it _is_ still confusing. However, I can definitely see the value, especially when you are reusing functions repeatedly. I'm still trying to wrap my head around classes, as the one exercise we used them in was refactoring the Connect Four project, but that's about it. Like anything: it'll come with practice.

**jQuery and Bootstrap**: I haven't finished the Bootstrap section yet, as I'm still trying to catch up after being sick. Going through that one video or so at a time when work is slower. As for jQuery? I understand the appeal _and_ the disdain. Well, maybe not the disdain; rather, the criticism. I love how clean and concise jQuery is, but I also can see why it was important before the major overhaul JavaScript has gone through.

**AJAX and AXIOS**: Okay, this section has been a blast. There is a lot to understand, especially when it comes to looping through data from the APIs and such, but there is so much potential for creativity and artistry here. In fact, it inspired me to start working on a portfolio piece. I'm really trying to find things to work on outside of the curriculum so by the time I graduate, I have more than the capstones to put on my resume. I'm done with the GIPHY page (well, it's submitted, but I have plans to rework a few things), and now I'm working on the TV Maze project before starting on the Jeopardy assessment. Despite how extensive that one is, I am excited to the nth degree.

Here's to another week!
