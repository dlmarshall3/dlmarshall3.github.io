Bootcamp: week nine
-----------------------

_Listening to: "Peach Club" by Emarosa_ 

...what a week. I don't even know where to begin. What I want to write about, I'll wait for a later date. I'm not one to believe you can "jinx yourself," but I also don't like sharing about events until everything is a bit more established. Let's just say if you're of the praying type? I would greatly, greatly appreciate your prayers.

**Bootcamp time:**

After finally making it through Hack-or-Snooze (barely...what an experience), I set foot in the wonderful land of Python. This is my first exposure to back-end programming, and while I haven't quite put the ideas into practice in a project context, it's been a great (if not refreshing) experience to learn a new language and...well, not feel overwhelmed. The syntax is clean, and already being familiar with the idea of loops and functions, at this point I'm just having to remind myself not to throw in let's and const's when it feels like they're needed.

I mean, look at how great this looks:

I also bought a Udemy course on React yesterday, because even though the curriculum will touch on React eventually, I wanted to get a headstart. As I casually peruse job listings on either LinkedIn or Indeed, I'd wager 80% of the experience requested has to do with React and Node.js, so why not get familiar now? Now, I can't imagine **starting** with React before Javascript, but now? Let's give it a shot! What do I have to lose?

It's not bootcamp related, but I've had fun working on some extracurricular projects. I'm almost done with a working website for my coworker's detail business. I just need a few more photos for his portfolio, and then I'll have to work with him to set up the domain name and hosting. What's fun is as I learn new languages and become familiar with libraries like React, the site is only going to look better and better. I'm also working on a "Christmas card" page of sorts. Nothing super fancy, but considering my Christmas-skeptical heart has thawed (long story here), I'm excited to finish it all up!

**Sermon time:**

Let's be honest: I'm a pastor at heart. I can find a sermon in almost anything in life. In an alternate universe, I did end up going through an ordination process to be a pastor for a small parish, but since this is not that universe, I'll keep trying to find wisdom to share and pray the Lord takes those seeds and grows something wonderful.

What I had in mind today is how I learned to celebrate when other people succeed...and you don't. I'm pretty sure I wrote about it last week (edit: [yes, I did](https://dlmarshall3.github.io/2021/11/26/bootcamp-week-eight.html)), but back in 2009, I joined a band in South Bend, Indiana, and in 2010, we signed to one of my favorite record labels. Which was surreal, let's be honest! But that didn't mean we were "successful" in the typical sense. Far from it.

Fastforward to 2011, I left the band to move back to Kansas City, and the guy who was filling in on guitar, Elisha, ended up taking over both guitar and vocal duties. From there, the band got a lot better. Like........ There's no comparison. The two albums they did after I left, _Light and Perfections_ and _In the Taking of Flesh_ are phenomenal. I listen to them regularly. Eventually, the band broke up, but Elisha didn't slow down. He started a side project with Ole BÃ¸rud, of Extol fame, which did well. He then joined one of the most popular Christian metal bands of all time, War of Ages, and has stayed busy since then. (On bass, but still.)

I say all of this because of course I could be salty that someone else got the success and recognition I wish I would have received. But then I think, "That wasn't meant to be my path." If I wouldn't have quit the band, I wouldn't have met my wife and started the wonderful family we have now. And if I wouldn't have quit the band, Elisha's life would look drastically different as well, and he's a great guy. He works hard, he's an amazing husband, and I'm proud of where he's at!

In the context of software engineering, it's easy to look at other people getting jobs before you and think you're doing something wrong, that you'll never get what they have. To be fair, we need to be honest: **you might be doing something wrong.** Your resume might be turning people off, or maybe your interview skills need some work. Or maybe you're just applying to places that aren't open to new talent, which isn't your fault. But the point being: celebrating when other people succeed does help you in the long run. I can't help but think of Romans 12: _"Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep."_ Being able to cheer on our colleagues and peers helps reorient our heart posture. It keeps us being thankful, recognizing everyone is on a different path, but discipline, diligence, and patience will pay off in the end. It doesn't mean it's easy. Far from it. But I continually think about the legacy I'm going to leave behind with my life, and I really don't want to be known as someone who constantly grumbled and was cantankerous. I want to be someone who invested in others, who recognized the trials of this life provide us the opportunities to become stronger and better people.

Anyway, that was a rambling mess, but hopefully someone finds something worthwhile in that heap.

**Other thoughts:**
- Hawkeye is a lot better than it deserves to be. I don't watch much TV at all these days, but I think the future of franchises like Star Wars and the MCU are in the streaming format. Speaking of Star Wars: very, very excited for **the Book of Boba Fett.**
- I keep thinking about picking _Metroid Dread_ back up, but...what a hard game. Maybe when I'm done with the bootcamp.
- Can we fast-forward to October 20, 2023 please? I really want to watch Dune pt 2.
